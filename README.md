# bookrecs
Book recommendations, formatted as JSON lines files with directories of cover images.

Book recommendations are organized under directories associated with the major or initial category attributes listed in JSON records. 

Recommendations are provided in numbered batches. So under finance, we see the finance-001 directory with its associated JSON lines file (finance-001.jsl) and directory of cover images (finance-001-covers). We also see the sports-001 directory with its associated JSON lines file (sports-001.jsl) and directory of cover images (sports-001-covers).
